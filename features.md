### UI Improvement Ideas

- select app theme
- green text for completed todos; red for overdue
- change text color when complete instead of strike-through
- navbar should be full width, content should be narrower
- lighten the background when color coding by priority
- pagination (user can set items per page)
- skeleton loading
- drag and drop todos
- datepicker disappears when clicking outside on detail view
- card view / list view / detail view / calendar view toggle
- keyboard shortcut for navigating detail view
